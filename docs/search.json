Iâ€™m Mikail, Data scientist @AlloFresh, where i work on range of analytics challanges including as customer insights, fraud detection, as well as developing search logics and recommendation system.\nI earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Malaya. During my study, I worked on experimentation and causal inference problems @Bukalapak.\nIn my free time, I love diving deep into causal inference and econometrics. Recently, Iâ€™ve also been growing pyfixest, a high-dimensional fixed effects regression package in Python, designed to replicate the functionality of the original fixest package in R. My work can be found on my Github!\n\nRecent Posts\n\nWhat If Your Grocery App Could Read Your Mind?\n\nOct 2024\n\n\nSee all posts"
