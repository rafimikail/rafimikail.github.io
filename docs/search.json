    "text": "This article serves a dual purpose: it is both a collection of my personal learning notes and a comprehensive introduction to recommender systems for those interested in exploring the field. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or aiming to deepen your understanding, this guide designed to provide clear, intuitive explanations of key concepts for high-level understanding, along with technical details of popular methods used in the industry.\n\n\nHave you ever been scrolling through social media, browsing an e-commerce site, or using another online platform, and found yourself amazed when the app suddenly suggests ads or products that pick your interest so much so that you end up clicking on them? Or perhaps you‚Äôve noticed how a system can predict what you‚Äôre about to type before you even finish? These are all powered by recommender systems, which have become a cornerstone of modern digital experiences.\nRecommendation systems, when built effectively, do much more than just predict your next move, they can enhance the overall user experience, drive engagement, and increase conversions from a business perspective. For example, think about how Netflix suggests movies based on your viewing history or how Amazon recommends products tailored to your shopping habits. These systems personalize the content or products you see, making your interactions with these platforms more relevant and efficient.\nYou might also wonder, ‚ÄúIf we want to get the best recommendations, why not just rank by popularity? Sort by the most transacted products, for example, if we‚Äôre dealing with an e-commerce platform.‚Äù Well, you could, but it won‚Äôt always deliver the best results. For one, the definition of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù may not align with a specific user‚Äôs preferences, leading to a less personalized experience. Simply focusing on the most popular items can also limit diversity, offering the same suggestions repeatedly, which may not be engaging or helpful for every user. These are just a few of the challenges that arise in recommender systems, where personalization and diversity play crucial roles in creating seamless experience.\nThere are various approaches and methods for building recommender systems, each addressing different user needs and preferences. This article will explore the most commonly used methods, how they work, and the kinds of problems they aim to solve."

I‚Äôm Mikail, Data scientist @AlloFresh, where i work on range of analytics challanges including customer insights, fraud detection, as well as developing search logics and recommendation system.\nI earned my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from the University of Malaya. During my study, I worked on experimentation and causal inference problems @Bukalapak.\nIn my free time, I love diving deep into causal inference and econometrics. Recently, I‚Äôve also been helping to grow pyfixest, a high-dimensional fixed effects regression package in Python, designed to replicate the functionality of the original fixest package in R.\n\nRecent Posts\n\nWhat If Your Grocery App Could Read Your Mind?\n\nOct 2024\n\n\nSee all posts"
