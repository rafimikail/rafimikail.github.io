# Rafi Mikail

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Mikail, Data scientist @AlloFresh, where i tackle various analytics problems such as customer insights, fraud detection, as well as developing search and recommendation system.

I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Malaya. During my study, I worked on experimentation and causal inference problems @Bukalapak.

In my free time, I love diving deep into causal inference and econometrics. I also help to develop pyfixest, a high-dimensional fixed effects regression package in Python. My work can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/rafimikail)!
