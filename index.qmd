# Rafi Mikail

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Mikail, Data scientist @AlloFresh, where i work on range of analytics challanges including as customer insights, fraud detection, as well as developing search logics and recommendation system.

I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Malaya. During my study, I worked on experimentation and causal inference problems @Bukalapak.

In my free time, I love diving deep into causal inference and econometrics. Recently, Iâ€™ve also been growing [pyfixest](https://py-econometrics.github.io/pyfixest/pyfixest.html), a high-dimensional fixed effects regression package in Python, designed to replicate the functionality of the original [fixest](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/) package in R. My work can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/rafimikail)!
